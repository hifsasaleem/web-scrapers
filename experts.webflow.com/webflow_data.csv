Giving them ownership and the means move the needle forward - in whatever direction they’re headed. With no-code, we help them scale up quickly without boundaries.

We don’t cut corners, but accelerate creativity by simplifying the process. We add by subtracting to push a new generation of makers forward.

Our mindset is to strive for more of the new, and less of the same. Always open to change, and never closed off to new possibilities.

Meaning brands can move faster, build smarter, and scale more, by coding less.",https://cutthecode.com,"$15,000"

My focus is on custom-built, fast-loading, and optimized websites, featuring clean lines, white space, and solid colors that produce a modern and timeless aesthetic.  

I believe that each client's needs are unique, and I take them through a comprehensive journey that ensures they get exactly what they're looking for. My process includes Discovery, Strategy, Research, Content Strategy & Information Architecture, Art Direction, Wireframing, Visual Design, and Development, all designed to give you a seamless website building experience.  

Before starting my own venture, I worked for the world-renowned advertising agency McCann Erickson, where I had the pleasure of working with amazing clients like Aldi and the Rugby World Cup. Now, I build all my themes from the ground up, prioritizing User Experience (UX), speed, and clean, simple design.  

As Google prioritizes user experience over most other search engine indicators, I place a strong emphasis on website speed as it affects critical metrics like dwell time, bounce rate, and click-through. These metrics show user intent and engagement, which ultimately affects organic SEO.  

I take web design and development a step further by incorporating storytelling to produce websites that are genuinely unique. I love focusing on video-content-driven websites because viewers retain around 95% of a message when they watch a video, compared to 10% when reading it in text.  

I prefer to not use pre-built themes or plugins, focusing instead on crafting clean, efficient, and concise code. I aim for most of the sites I build to load in 2-3 seconds, which is faster than 98% of the internet and a massive SEO indicator.  

I believe in giving back to society and the environment, and a central point of my ethos is to contribute positively to social and environmental causes. If there isn't anything specific that your brand does, don't worry; I'll take a portion of the job and put it towards making a positive impact.

With companies now adapting to the new method of doing business online, this shift created immense growth for Digital Agencies like yours.

In line with these, based on a recent survey, these are the top challenges growing agencies are facing right now:
- Finding new clients
- Hiring the best talents 
- Client retention 

In order to meet the high demands of projects, agency owners need to work with a person or a company that helps them fulfill the project and get it done on time.

On the other hand, my team and I have worked with several digital agencies, and these are the ones they most complain about when working with individuals:
- Poor Website Quality
- Unscalable Project
- Missed Deadlines

We understand how difficult it is to find a person or a company to work with that can help build a high-quality, easy-to-scale website that is done in a short span of time.

Here at Brylliant Solutions, we value your every second's worth and strive to complete our clients' work timely and accurately.

With us on your team, you'll never have to worry about poor website quality, unscalable projects, hiring unreliable freelancers, or missed deadlines again…

So there are 
- NO MORE Additional stress
- NO MORE Extra development cost
- NO MORE Low revenue
- NO MORE Financial loss
- NO MORE Hiring another person to do the project

We simply help digital agencies thrive and support more businesses by building fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly websites.

No Guesswork.,"Hi there! My name is Chris and what most businesses do is end up investing a lot of money and time into their website design. Let's cut trough all the crap. A beautiful and shinny Webflow site won't guarantee you success! But you already know this. Right? 

You're here because your gut knows, you can't just find a good Webflow Expert. You need someone who can guarantee you conversions and cashflow. Not those that say ""attention to detail and great design"". If that's what you need, your business is doomed. 

(*because those Benjamins don't hang on trees*)

But what if I told you that in 4 weeks from now you can own a Webflow site that generate sales. With a 93% accuracy. Why such number? See, on top of doing Webflow since 2016, I also do A.I predictive design, eliminate guesswork through analytics/heatmaps, and help you achieve business productivity through automation.

So what am I offering? A Done-For-You service that transform your Webflow into a scientific conversion-driven website. Nu fluffy animations and big logos. Only proven design that extend your business online.

Built-in CMS
Content Management plays a quintessential role in sales and marketing efforts. We consider it a by default standard built into our solutions by design instead of a mere afterthought.  

High-quality SEO
Improving the quality and quantity of your web traffic is vital in order to ensure that your message reaches the right audience. We make sure that the set targets are accurate.

Redesign & Rebrand
Change is inevitable in an organization's life and the primary indicator is always the website. Make sure when such a time comes you rely on people who know how it should be done.

High-performance
A slow website is almost as good as having no website at all. Even a split second of downtime can drive away precious prospects. We can make sure that such a thing will never happen.

Conversion-focused
Having a high number of website visitors is only as good as the conversion rate. We make sure that none of those you wish to do business with will bounce off, but will wish to reach out to you.

Customer friendliness
Customer Experience is as important as the contents of your website. If a visitor feels lost they will leave almost immediately but if their experience is smooth they will want to stick around.

User friendliness
User Experience is about the same principle as Customer friendliness but it is in regards to your team who will work on the site on a daily basis. We make sure their experience is also smooth.

Webflow team feature: My personal portfolio is on the showcase/popular section as one of the best websites built with Webflow.

Communication: I went to college on a full-ride scholarship through the number one speech and debate team in the U.S at WKU. I graduated with a B.F.A in design. Being able to tell a story is single handedly the most important part of working on a team. Being able to understand one another and overcome obstacles by coming to the best possible solution is all a result of clearly communicating on an action plan and being able to execute aggressively.

Initiative: I began my career working at small startups where the only way to make an impact is to do a lot more than your job description requires you to do. Over-delivering has become part of my DNA. I learned how to work along side business requirements, user needs and engineering limitations to create the biggest return on investment for my clients.

Growth: Measuring success before and after a project launch is a great way to manage expectations. I do not confuse movement for progress.

At Zickert Media, we know that businesses depend on qualified new customers for stable growth.

To accomplish that, you need a website that brings in new customers and marketing that draws attention to their business.

The problem for many business owners is that their current website is not generating customers, which frustrates them and makes them doubt whether a website can generate customers for them at all.

We don't think a website should just be pretty and cost money. A website must work and make money for you!

The basis for this is a clear marketing strategy. Goals must be defined. This enables a clear communication and positioning of your company.

Once the plan and goals are in place, the appropriate marketing measures can be developed. Be it the website, online advertising, search engine optimization or email marketing.

Only with the right plan can a website be developed that works.

We understand how frustrating it is to put a lot of work and money into a website and then nothing happens.

Story is Where it Starts
Story is the fundamental way that people come to understand and relate to the world, so we look at the role of story as a ""back to basics"" way to organize and understand how to wrangle an ever-growing, ever-more-complicated mix of marketing messages and technology platforms.

Content is Design
Every successful web project is also a successful content project. We know from experience that content can make or break a site; that at the end of the day, the medium will be the message. And if the medium — the website — is not a fully realized narrative beyond the confines of a flat PDF of designed pages, your brand's story (and differentiator, and that shiver of connection you want people to feel regarding what you do or make) will end up as many well-thought and intentioned brand stories do…lost in translation.

I am an independent web designer with a mission to leave a lasting impact. I create impact through thoughtful designs, applying scientifically proven methods, and testing directly from the user in the website creation process.

During our partnership, my top priority is to fully understand your business/project, convey your message and vision, and let the results speak for themselves based on data.

I work on an independent basis and as a freelancer. In my past I have worked with e-commerce clients, regional sustainable businesses and social impact associations. (You can find case studies on my website www.danielwallmueller.com).
